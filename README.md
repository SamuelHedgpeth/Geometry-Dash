Tips for a really fun game!

Geometry Dash is a very cool game about jumping over spikes and trying not to run into certain objects.

You can get it on any device, but it costs $2.

So, let's get started!

I will share a few strategies and things to do with you so that you will have the number one stuff for Geometry Dash!

1. Listen to the music to help time your jumps.

2. Look for fake blocks to get a secret coin (or user coin, if you are online.)

3. Look for spikes before you on a ring. (A ring is a circle thingy that comes in colors of blue, yellow, and purple. The blue ones reverse your gravity, the yellow ones let you jump three blocks in the air, and the purple ones let you jump two blocks in the air.

4. When searching for online levels, edit the settings to find a level you'd like.

5. If you get 10 user coins, go to settings and open up the vault on the top right hand corner.

6. Enter these codes in the vault: lenny, blockbite, your username, neverending, 8, 16, 30, 32, 46, 84 (NUMBERS IN ORDER), mule, spooky, and sparky.

7. Touch the icons on the front screen to get special colors, icons, and more!

8. Get an account in the settings page to create your own user page!
